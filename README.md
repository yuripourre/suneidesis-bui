# AAL
Accessibility Abstraction Layer (AAL)

An alternative way to integrate high-level actions with software.

This idea born from a need to teach bots how to interact with existing software, it is also useful to address accessibility issues in general software.

In the future might be possible to integrate speech-to-text instructions with AAL so it would be even easier to operate software.
